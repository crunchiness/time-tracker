# time-tracker
It's a GNOME Shell extension the purpose of which is to track time you spend on work / productively / your-purpose.

There's just a single toggle button / indicator at the top bar (Ubuntu), which switches on or off the stopwatch like timer.

There's a complementing (very simple) localhost [server](https://github.com/crunchiness/time-tracker-server) which records all the clicks and thus can produce accurate stats!

The main idea is that anything other than a single click is definitely too cumbersome... Ideally, there'd be a physical toggle with a light!

Currently in indefinite pre-pre-release beta testing (I'm using it).
